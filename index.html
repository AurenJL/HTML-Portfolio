      <h2>My movie ranking project</h2>
         <p>This project started by learning how to use paragraph elements, horizontal rules, breaks, etc. I then added some images and made them into clickable hyperlinks! Be sure to click the image of the project to visit the project page!</p>

      <h3>A birthday invite!</h3>
         <p>I know sounds a tad bit lame, but it was fun to make. I learned about image elements and finally how to add hyperlinks!</p>
         <p>I really did tke some creative liberties with this one, but is was all in good fun! I certainly do not have the capacity to blow stuff up, I can barely operate a microwave.</p>
