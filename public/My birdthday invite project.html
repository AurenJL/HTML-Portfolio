<h1>It's time for my birthday! The best international holiday that all countries have unanimously agreed to celebrate, esspecially not due to threat of nuclear violence!</h1>
<h2>Save the date! November 7th, be there or be blown to hell! Jk, but not really.</h2>

<h3>Things that you should pretty much definitely bring. Actually these are hard requirements:</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Paint balls</li>
   <li>A paintball marker if you wish to defend yourself</li>
   <li>Children old enough to be shot with paintballs, but not old enough to properly fire a paintball marker</li>
   <li>Money, the more the marrier!</li>
   <li>The money is for me in case that wasn't clear</li>
</ul>

<h4>Where to go to be a part of such an amazing, epic, awesome, bomb-ass party you ask?! Well, hell of course:</h4>
